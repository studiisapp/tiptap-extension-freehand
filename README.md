# Tiptap Freehand Drawing Extension

A Tiptap node that embeds a canvas for freehand drawing using `perfect-freehand`.
This demo repo includes a Vite + React example app.

## Quickstart

```bash
pnpm i # or npm i / yarn
pnpm dev # or npm run dev / yarn dev
```

In the editor toolbar, click **Insert Drawing** to add a drawing block. Draw with mouse or stylus.
The node stores vector paths in its attributes and re-renders from data.
